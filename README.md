Using AR for web apps
=================
This a website that I built to make AR that can be applied for education
As I am still learning about AR so the app is not stable
Feel free to report any issue with the app
The app couldn't be built without the help of Glitch for development. Find out more [about Glitch](https://glitch.com/about).


Augrumented Reality in Education
------------
# Overview":
    * The website used Bootstrap to build mobile first website.
    * The website alone already inlcude user guide for end user
    * There might be some performance issue since the library it used still under development


# Note:
  * The website app is still in development process so it will have some weird or bad code in there. Feel free to contact me for any issue
