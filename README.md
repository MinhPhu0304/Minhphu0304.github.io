Using AR for web apps
=================
This a website that I built to make AR that can be applied for education
As I am still learning about AR so the app is not stable
Feel free to report any issue with the app
The app couldn't be built without the help of Glitch for development. Find out more [about Glitch](https://glitch.com/about).

# Note:
  * The website app is still in development process so it will have some weird or bad code in there. Feel free to contact me for any issue 

In the mean time. If you would like to know what I have done so far, you can visit my [github profile](https://github.com/MinhPhu0304)
